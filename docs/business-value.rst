The RADON Monitoring Tool, part of the RADON Delivery Toolchain, aims to provide RADON users
with a way to monitor the deployment metrics in order to get insight with regard to
the proper performance of a Serverless application. When deploying resources in a public
or private cloud infrastructure one should have a way to control how the deployed topologies
operate by continuously monitoring metrics or thresholds of interest in order to be able to
identify, assess and address any possible issues.

The RADON Monitoring Tool offers a unified monitoring model that can be applied at any level of
abstraction (container, process, serverless function) and which can be defined and deployed
within the TOSCA based modeling of a serverless infrastructure itself. Introducing a
unified monitoring approach can result in downtime reduction by automatic adjustments of
the capacity of the deployed infrastructure through continuous monitoring and auto scaling. In this way,
we eliminate the risk of disruptions in the business continuity operations.
